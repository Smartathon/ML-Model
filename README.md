### Description: 

Visual pollution is a relatively recent issue compared to other forms of environmental contamination.  The natural beauty of our cities has been marred by many signboards and cluttered overhead wires. Majorly these are ruining the Aesthetics and Greenage of our environment. These effects can be psychological, impacting our ability to enjoy the world around us. The above factors are driving us to take up this challenge.


It is imperative to study and define, formalize, measure, and evaluate it from many angles.


In this competition, our team aims to establish a new field of automated visual pollution classification.
By training and testing approaches to convolutional neural networks, we expect to simulate the human learning experience in the context of picture identification for the
classification of visual pollutants.

Additionally, this will be useful for the development of a "visual pollution score/index" for urban areas that might produce a new "metric" or "indicator" in the discipline of urban environmental
management.

In this competition, we have built and optimized algorithms based on a large-scale dataset that was provided to us. This dataset featured the raw sensor camera inputs as perceived by a fleet of multiple vehicles in a restricted geographic area in KSA. 

For now, our model is able to predict reasonably well with more than 81% accuracy by using the VGG16 algorithm. 

The main highlight is:

* Implementation of transfer learning and 

* Anomaly detection methods

In the future, we have planned to include YoloV5 and to do ensemble modeling for better accuracy and prediction.
